      <p> I completed the following: 
        <ul> 
          <li> I performed the following steps in repl.it </li>
        </ul>
          <ol type="a"> 
            <li> Added a folder to my root directory called files</li>
            <li> Added a folder to the files folder called pages</li>
            <li> Added the following files to the pages folder: </li>
               <ul style="list-style-type:square;">
              <li> page1.html </li>
              <li> page2.html </li>
              <li> page3.html </li>
            </ul>
          </ol>
        <ul>
          <li> My index.html contains the following: </li> 
          <ol type= 1>
            <li> a title appropriate for the content of the page </li>
            <li> all of the semantic elements covered in this unit </li>
            <li> a heading for the page using the largest heading </li> 
            <li> three hyperlinks to the pages created earlier </li>
            <li> at least two paragraph elements </li>
            <li> a listed structure consiting of at least two nested lists </li>
            <li> an ordered list which orders items by lowercase letters</li> 
            <li> at least three character codes which may include: space, &amp;, &copy;, &lt;, &gt;, etc. </li>
          </ol>
       </ul>
      </p>
    <h3> Explanation </h3>
  <p> I know this may seem like an oddly familiar paper to you. That.s because it is, however slightly altered. I sat here wondering how I could make a paper including all of the items listed without forgetting any. The idea of rewriting the instructions for myself and checking them off as I went along came up. Hopefully this explains everything a little better. Oh, and don't worry, I wrote another version on page 1 just in case this doesn't count as original. Thanks for your time.</p>
